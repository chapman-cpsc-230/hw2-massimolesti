## Description

Made 2 programs: one calculated sum `1 + b + b^2 + ... + b^n`using variables b and n provided by the user. The other was a cooling model relating the temperature of a cup of tea to the temperature of the air after a certain number of minutes.
## What I Learned from This

Learned how to better utilize while functions. Also, learned some formatting using the %x.x character numberings for place-holders.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
